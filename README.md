# Diff Coverage

Diff Coverage is a VS Code extension that visualizes test coverage for modified code by combining **git diff** with **ExCoveralls** coverage reports.

The extension highlights which changed lines are covered by tests and which are not.

---

## Features

- Compare current changes against any recent Git commit
- Read coverage data from `./cover/excoveralls.json`
- Display changed lines with coverage highlighting
- Built-in commit picker (last 100 commits)
- Native VS Code styling and theme integration

---

## How It Works

1. The extension reads Git changes.
2. It loads coverage information from ExCoveralls.
3. It matches changed lines with coverage data.
4. It shows the result in a formatted preview.

---

## Requirements

You must have:

- Git installed and available in PATH
- Coverage file generated at: `./cover/excoveralls.json`

## Usage
